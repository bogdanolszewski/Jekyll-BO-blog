I am a Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience in creating and optimizing solutions on various technological stacks. I enjoy working directly with clients, as that usually leads to more efficient work. After hours, I'm a Data Analysis enthusiast, constantly exploring new techniques, models, and tools to enhance my skills. I have a strong background in data modeling, analysis, and statistics. I'm reasonably proficient in languages such as `Python`, `SQL`, `DAX`, `VBA`, and `R`. I have hands-on experience with tools like `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Power Apps`, `Power Automate`, `Azure Logic Apps`, `DAX Studio`, `Tabular Editor`, `Data Factory`, `SQL Server Data tools`, `Excel`, and more. I am comfortable working with project management tools like `Jira`, `Confluence`, `Azure DevOps`, and `Git` version control systems. <br>
In addition to that I possess strong soft skills such as open, honest communication and willingness to participate in discssions. I treat each individual problem with `respect` and `diligence`. I believe this mindset allows companies to evade technical debt and keep on innovating, without leaving loose ends behind. I consider myself greatly `flexible` and quickly adapt to new environments. I am fluent in `English`, both written and spoken, and proficient in `German`, enough to hold conversation, read documentation or participate in technical discussions. As I rather like learning languages, I also have basic knowledge of `French` and `Dutch`. In my free time, I indulge in hobbies like testing capabilites of `LLMs`, doing data visualization, or reading scientific articles.
